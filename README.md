TO SEE THE EXAMPLE SUMMARY WITH COMPASS:
run compass.py

To modify the arguments of compass:
R: this is based on the dataset. do not change unless you have other data you want to process
Q: this is the set of feature values. You can remove them or add more if you like, but be sure to update the relevant functions in path and compass. 
V: this is the set of feature values, and it is a function of R and Q. 
k: the number of specifications you want in each summary. Feel free to change this to any number less than or equal to t. 
t: this is always equal to the length of Q. Do not change this.
